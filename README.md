# Dinner-Decider
# Creator: Nicole Cotto

My goal for this application was to help indecisive people be able to decide a place to eat.
I wanted to do this by:
 1. Setting up a randomized generator based off of restaurants the users would give it
 2. Have a questionnaire that asks the user certain preferences they have in a  restuarant

Open the BeforeSignIn.html to start the application or 
use the link https://ncotto.github.io/DinnerDecider/BeforeSignIn.html

Then right-click the webpage and click Inspect. 
From here change the viewing of the application to iPhone 6/7/8

Once it is setup, you just have to sign in, any input will work. 
Then you can freely explore the application.
